# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this repositrory is to assist Robin in adding more polish to her web app by adding images of Mars's 4 hemispheres. In order to do this we will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemisphers and the titles of the images, store the scaped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accomodate these images.
